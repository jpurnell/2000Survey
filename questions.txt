Overall Alumni Satisfaction
	Feelings of connectedness
	Desire to help
		Do you volunteer for the class
		What's kept you from participating in the past?
		Do you have any specific skills or talents you'd like to contribute that you haven't been able to 
in the past? (Communications, Design, Technology, Fundraising, Fashion, etc?) We need all the help we can get…
	Do you donate?
		If not why?
			University has enough
			University doesn't appreciate my gift
			Other causes are more important to you
			Don't like the direction of the University
		What would it take for you to donate?
	Feelings about the 25th (May 22-25, 2025 – Note: Memorial Day Weekend)
		Do you plan on coming?
		What would keep you from coming?
			Housing
			Childcare
			Finances
			Other obligations
			I just don't go
		While we have you…jacket size?
		What do you expect in terms of quality for class jackets
		What you expect to spend on your class jacket?
